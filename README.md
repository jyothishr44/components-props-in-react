This project demonstrates the core React concept of reusability and data flow through props.
I built reusable components where the parent component (App) passes read-only values as props to child components (Person). This approach converts static UI elements into dynamic, data-driven components, improving flexibility and maintainability.

Key learnings:

1.Creating reusable React components 

2.Passing and accessing props in functional components

3.Rendering dynamic content using props

4.Understanding one-way data flow in React
